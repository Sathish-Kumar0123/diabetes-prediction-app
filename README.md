# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict whether a person is likely to have **diabetes** based on diagnostic medical measurements.  
We use the **Prima Indians Diabetes Dataset** and apply multiple **Machine Learning algorithms** such as:
- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest  
- XGBoost  

The goal is to build a model that can assist healthcare professionals in identifying at-risk individual

## 📊 Dataset
We used the **Prima Indians Diabetes Dataset**, which contains medical predictor variables and one target variable.
- **Features:**
  - Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant  
  - Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration (2-hour test)  
  - BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)  
  - SkinThickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)  
  - Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)  
  - BMI: Body Mass Index (weight in kg / (height in m)^2)  
  - DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Genetic risk factor  
  - Age: Age in years  

- **Target Variable:**
  - Outcome (0 = No Diabetes, 1 = Diabetes)

## ⚙️ Installation & Requirements
